# supermarket_simulation
Simulation and visualization of customer behaviour in a supermarket, based on data analysis and calculation of transition probabilties (Markov chain).

You can start the simulation by executing the python file 'simulation.py'.

The file 'calculate_transition_probabilities.py' will calculate the transition probabilties based on 'supermarket_data'.
